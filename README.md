# PageRank
Implements the basic PageRank and a topic-specific PageRank.

    How-To guide:
       1. Install python
            - If you don't have Microsoft Office, you'll need that too (for .docx Files)
       2. Clone repository
       3. Run "pip install -r requirements.txt" in the command line in the project root directory
       4. Run "streamlit run pagerank.py"
       
It might take a few seconds to boot up, but a Tab in your browser should open.
